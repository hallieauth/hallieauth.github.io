<p class="info">This is a video I created for the website <i>McCall Life</i> that my dad and I created for my senior project in high school. I shot and edited this video using Adobe Premiere Pro and learned how to utilize various aspects of that software throughout this project.</p>

<p class="info2"> This is another video I edited for <i>McCall Life</i>. In this video I had my friend Rose take the camera out with her on one of her adventures and I edited the footage she brought back. It tought me how to outline a video in order to explain it to someone else and how to make do with what I have.

<p class="locals2"> Above here is a ski movie my dad and I put together. I was able to interview some friends and film them skiing or snowboarding for this film as well. We took submissions from anyone who wanted to send us footage and we compiled it into the video you see here. I was able to practice my interview skills and filming skills outside for this video. It was really exciting to see what other footage people submitted as well. Here is the link to <a href="https://www.mccalllife.com/?msclkid=4c38e44ac59811ecb3f960c2361fd3cf"><i>McCall Life's</i></a> website. Below are some other images as well from various trips I have been lucky enough to take.</p>
